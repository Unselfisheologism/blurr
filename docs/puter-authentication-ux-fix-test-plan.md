# Puter Authentication UX Fix - Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the test plan for verifying the Puter authentication UX fix that addresses the issue where users were stuck on the authentication page after successful login.

## Changes Made
1. Created `PuterBackgroundService` to maintain Puter.js communication in the background
2. Updated `PuterWebViewActivity` to start the background service after successful authentication and redirect to main app
3. Updated `PuterManager` to properly manage the lifecycle of the background service

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Authentication Flow
**Objective**: Verify that the authentication flow works as expected

**Steps**:
1. Launch the app and navigate to the Puter authentication screen
2. Click the "Login with Puter" button
3. Complete the Puter authentication in the webview popup
4. Verify that after successful authentication:
   - The webview closes
   - The user is redirected to the main app (MainActivity or OnboardingPermissionsActivity)
   - A success toast message is displayed
   - The background service starts successfully

**Expected Results**:
- User should be redirected to the main app after authentication
- Background service should be running to maintain Puter.js communication
- No errors should occur during the redirect

### Test 2: Background Service Functionality
**Objective**: Verify that the background service maintains Puter.js communication

**Steps**:
1. Complete the authentication flow as described in Test 1
2. Use Puter.js functionality (e.g., file operations, KV store operations) from the main app
3. Verify that these operations work correctly

**Expected Results**:
- Puter.js operations should work correctly after authentication
- The background service should be maintaining the connection
- No authentication errors should occur when using Puter.js features

### Test 3: Service Lifecycle Management
**Objective**: Verify that the background service is properly managed

**Steps**:
1. Authenticate and verify the background service starts
2. Sign out from the app
3. Verify that the background service stops
4. Authenticate again and verify the service restarts

**Expected Results**:
- Background service should start on authentication
- Background service should stop on sign out
- Service lifecycle should be properly managed

### Test 4: Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify that error cases are handled properly

**Steps**:
1. Attempt to authenticate but cancel the process
2. Verify that the user remains on the appropriate screen
3. Attempt to authenticate with invalid credentials
4. Verify that proper error messages are displayed

**Expected Results**:
- Cancellation should be handled gracefully
- Error cases should display appropriate messages
- The app should remain in a stable state

### Test 5: App Restart
**Objective**: Verify that the authentication state persists across app restarts

**Steps**:
1. Complete authentication successfully
2. Close and restart the app
3. Verify that the user doesn't need to re-authenticate immediately
4. Verify that Puter.js functionality is available

**Expected Results**:
- Authentication state should persist
- User should not be forced to re-authenticate immediately
- Puter.js functionality should remain available

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Authentication popup works correctly
- [ ] User is redirected to main app after successful authentication
- [ ] Background service starts after authentication
- [ ] Puter.js functionality works from main app after redirect
- [ ] Background service stops on sign out
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Authentication state persists across app restarts
- [ ] No memory leaks from background service
- [ ] Notification appears for background service (if applicable)

## Success Criteria
The implementation is successful if:
1. Users are no longer stuck on the authentication page after successful login
2. The main app functionality is accessible after authentication
3. Puter.js communication is maintained in the background
4. All Puter.js features continue to work after the redirect
5. The solution is stable and doesn't introduce new issues
