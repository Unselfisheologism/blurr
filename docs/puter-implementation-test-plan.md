# Puter.js Implementation Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the Puter.js integration in the Blurr app.

## Overview

The Puter.js integration provides the following functionality:
1. AI chat capabilities
2. Text-to-image generation
3. Image-to-text conversion
4. Text-to-speech synthesis
5. Key-value storage
6. User authentication

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Authentication Tests

#### 1.1 Sign In
- Verify that the sign-in flow opens the Puter authentication page
- Verify that successful authentication returns a valid token
- Verify that failed authentication returns an appropriate error

#### 1.2 Sign Out
- Verify that signing out clears the authentication token
- Verify that after signing out, authenticated operations fail

#### 1.3 Authentication State Check
- Verify that `isSignedIn()` correctly reports the authentication state
- Verify that the authentication state persists across app sessions

### 2. AI Chat Tests

#### 2.1 Basic Chat
- Verify that sending a simple chat query returns a response
- Verify that the response is in the expected format

#### 2.2 Chat with Context
- Verify that chat with context (previous messages) works correctly
- Verify that the AI maintains conversation context

#### 2.3 Chat Error Handling
- Verify that invalid queries return appropriate errors
- Verify that network errors are handled gracefully

### 3. Text-to-Image Tests

#### 3.1 Basic Text-to-Image
- Verify that sending a text prompt generates an image
- Verify that the generated image is in the expected format

#### 3.2 Text-to-Image with Options
- Verify that text-to-image with quality options works correctly
- Verify that text-to-image with model options works correctly

#### 3.3 Text-to-Image Error Handling
- Verify that invalid prompts return appropriate errors
- Verify that size limit errors are handled correctly

### 4. Image-to-Text Tests

#### 4.1 Basic Image-to-Text
- Verify that sending an image returns extracted text
- Verify that the extracted text is accurate

#### 4.2 Image-to-Text with Complex Images
- Verify that complex images with text are processed correctly
- Verify that handwritten text is recognized

#### 4.3 Image-to-Text Error Handling
- Verify that invalid images return appropriate errors
- Verify that unsupported image formats are handled correctly

### 5. Text-to-Speech Tests

#### 5.1 Basic Text-to-Speech
- Verify that sending text generates audio
- Verify that the generated audio is playable

#### 5.2 Text-to-Speech with Options
- Verify that text-to-speech with language options works correctly
- Verify that text-to-speech with voice options works correctly

#### 5.3 Text-to-Speech Error Handling
- Verify that invalid text returns appropriate errors
- Verify that size limit errors are handled correctly

### 6. Key-Value Storage Tests

#### 6.1 Basic KV Operations
- Verify that setting a key-value pair works correctly
- Verify that getting a key-value pair returns the correct value
- Verify that deleting a key-value pair works correctly

#### 6.2 KV Operations with Different Data Types
- Verify that storing strings works correctly
- Verify that storing numbers works correctly
- Verify that storing booleans works correctly
- Verify that storing objects works correctly

#### 6.3 KV Error Handling
- Verify that invalid keys return appropriate errors
- Verify that size limit errors are handled correctly

### 7. Integration Tests

#### 7.1 Combined Operations
- Verify that multiple AI operations can be performed in sequence
- Verify that authenticated and unauthenticated operations work together

#### 7.2 Performance Tests
- Verify that operations complete within acceptable time limits
- Verify that the WebView approach doesn't cause memory leaks

#### 7.3 Error Recovery
- Verify that the system recovers gracefully from network errors
- Verify that the system recovers gracefully from authentication errors

## Test Execution

### Manual Testing
1. Install the app on a physical device
2. Run through each test scenario manually
3. Record results and any issues encountered

### Automated Testing
1. Implement unit tests for each component
2. Implement integration tests for combined operations
3. Run tests on multiple device configurations

## Expected Results

All test scenarios should pass with no critical or high-severity issues. Minor issues should be documented and addressed in future releases.

## Issue Tracking

Any issues discovered during testing should be tracked in the project's issue tracker with the following information:
- Test scenario that failed
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual results
- Device and OS information
- Screenshots or logs if applicable
