# Puter.js Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Puter.js integration in the Android application, including all implemented features and their usage.

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a service-based architecture with the following components:

1. **PuterService** - Manages the persistent WebView that runs Puter.js
2. **PuterBridge** - Handles communication between native Android code and JavaScript
3. **PuterManager** - Provides a high-level API for interacting with Puter.js features
4. **HTML Bridge** - The HTML file loaded in the WebView that contains all Puter.js bridge functions

## Implemented Features

### Authentication
- `puter.auth.signIn()` - Initiates the sign-in process
- `puter.auth.signOut()` - Signs out the current user
- `puter.auth.isSignedIn()` - Checks if user is signed in
- `puter.auth.getUser()` - Gets user information

### AI Features
- `puter.ai.chat()` - Basic chat functionality
- `puter.ai.chat()` with streaming - Streaming chat responses
- `puter.ai.txt2img()` - Text-to-image generation
- `puter.ai.img2txt()` - Image-to-text (OCR)
- `puter.ai.txt2speech()` - Text-to-speech conversion

### Key-Value Store
- `puter.kv.set()` - Set a key-value pair
- `puter.kv.get()` - Get a value by key
- `puter.kv.del()` - Delete a key
- `puter.kv.list()` - List all keys
- `puter.kv.incr()` - Increment a numeric value
- `puter.kv.decr()` - Decrement a numeric value
- `puter.kv.flush()` - Clear all data

### File System
- `puter.fs.write()` - Write data to a file
- `puter.fs.read()` - Read data from a file
- `puter.fs.mkdir()` - Create a directory
- `puter.fs.readdir()` - List directory contents
- `puter.fs.delete()` - Delete a file or directory
- `puter.fs.move()` - Move a file or directory
- `puter.fs.copy()` - Copy a file or directory
- `puter.fs.rename()` - Rename a file or directory
- `puter.fs.stat()` - Get file/directory information
- `puter.fs.space()` - Get storage space information

## Usage Examples

### Initializing PuterManager
```kotlin
val puterManager = PuterManager.getInstance(context)
puterManager.initialize()
```

### Chat Operations
```kotlin
// Basic chat
puterManager.chat("Hello, how are you?").thenApply { response ->
    // Handle response
}.exceptionally { throwable ->
    // Handle error
}

// Streaming chat
puterManager.chatStream("Tell me a story", onChunkCallback = { chunk ->
    // Handle each chunk as it arrives
}).thenApply { completeResponse ->
    // Handle complete response
}
```

### File System Operations
```kotlin
// Write a file
puterManager.fsWrite("hello.txt", "Hello, world!").thenApply { response ->
    // Handle response
}

// Read a file
puterManager.fsRead("hello.txt").thenApply { content ->
    // Handle content
}
```

### Key-Value Operations
```kotlin
// Set a value
puterManager.kvSet("username", "john_doe").thenApply { success ->
    if (success) {
        // Value set successfully
    }
}

// Get a value
puterManager.kvGet("username").thenApply { value ->
    // Handle value
}
```

## Error Handling

All operations return CompletableFuture objects that properly handle both success and error cases. The implementation includes proper error propagation from JavaScript to native code.

## Security Considerations

- Authentication is handled through Chrome Custom Tabs to avoid WebView security issues
- Each app has its own sandboxed environment within the user's Puter account
- Communication between JavaScript and native code is properly secured

## Testing

A comprehensive test activity `PuterFullTestActivity` is included that tests all implemented features.

## Dependencies

- `androidx.browser:browser` - For Chrome Custom Tabs
- Android WebView component

## Known Limitations

- Streaming chat responses are handled as complete responses after streaming is done
- Some AI features like image generation may have associated costs
- File operations are limited by Puter's file system permissions
